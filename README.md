# Train-Scheduler
This is a Firebase backed train schedule application. It uses HTML, CSS and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.

Uses Firebase to host train data including: first train time, frequency of train, train name and destination. 
Available data will be retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various 
trains arrival times and minutes until arrival.

The application does update the current time and the arrival time and minutes to arrival on its own with out refreshing the screen.
